    <p>Hi there! I'm Sri Karthikeya Bhagavatula, a passionate Developer who loves to bring ideas to life and create meaningful connections through technology and design. With a background in public demonstration and a love for storytelling, I’ve dedicated myself to creating projects that leave a lasting impact and inspire others.</p>

    <p>I started my journey with a fascination for problem-solving and coding, and since then, I've been committed to finding innovative solutions. My approach is all about making complex ideas accessible and prioritizing user appealing design.</p>

    <p>Although I’m just starting out in web development, I’ve already had the opportunity to work on a few exciting projects that have deepened my skills and fueled my passion for this industry. Through hands-on experiences, like building my own website, I've gained a foundational understanding of relevant skills, such as HTML and CSS and design fundamentals.</p>

    <p>Beyond work, I'm someone who believes in lifelong learning. When I'm not working on my latest project, you'll find me getting lost in a good book, lifting iron, speaking publicly and having a good swim in the pool. These interests keep me inspired and grounded, helping me bring fresh perspectives into everything I do.</p>

    <p>I’m continuously building on my beginner skills through online courses and playing with additional features of a particular language, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges that push my abilities further. I may be at the beginning of my journey, but I bring a fresh perspective, an eagerness to learn, and a commitment to excellence in every project I undertake.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for someone who brings passion, dedication, and a unique touch to their work, I'm excited to connect. Let’s create something incredible together!</p>
